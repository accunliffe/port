  h4.modalContent.topper What is stockickr?
  p.moder1 stockickr was a startup I tried to get off the ground. Working crazy hours with just my cofounder we made it to the beta stage before running out of our savings. Along the way he taught me a lot about writing code, and the best ways to teach myself. I also learned a lot about web and mobile design.

  h4.modalContent What Part did I Play?
  p.moder1 At stockickr I worked on everything except back end development.
  h4.modalContent Why stockickr?
  p.moder1 I found myself with two main problems: "there is a huge amount of traders and investors on the internet talking about their trades and investments, but there is no way to verify their buying and selling," and "NFL players play in college, high school, and pee wee before going pro, why is there no securities trading in college, even just as a game?"

  h4.modalContent What Did I Learn?
  p.moder1 I learned how to write front-end code in Javascript, AngularJS, CSS, and HTML, in a limited, but functional, capacity. I read everything online I oculd find about web and mobile design, in every aspect. I leapt into using OmniGraffle to mockup my sketches using visual design practices for desktop and mobile applications.<br><br>Although I did not see my app to market, I learned some of the most valuable knowledge possible. I immersed myself in design and development, while learning a lot about myself along the way. I learned I can work my heart out for something I believe in, even when there is no clear reward in sight.
